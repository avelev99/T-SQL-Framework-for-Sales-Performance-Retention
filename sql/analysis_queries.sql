    analysis_queries.sql

    This file contains example Tâ€‘SQL queries to derive insights from the
    ECommerceMiniDW warehouse.  They correspond roughly to the metrics
    produced in the Python analysis: monthly revenue, top product
    categories by sales and a simple customer retention measure.
    Analysts can run these queries in SQL Server Management Studio or
    equivalent tools.

    For each customer, count the number of distinct purchase months.

    repeat customers.  The retention rate is the fraction of repeat
    customers over the total number of customers.  Cast to decimal to
    obtain a fractional value.
